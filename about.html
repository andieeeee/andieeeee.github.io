<p>Hi! I'm Andie. I am a junior at Northwestern University studying Computer Science and Gender & Sexuality Studies. Thank you for visiting my website!</p>
<br>
<p>My areas of interest are in front-end design and video game development. I hope to use my gender studies background and personal experiences of disability to create diverse and accessible games!</p>

<p>I'm from Wichita, KS, Jefferson City/Columbia, MO, and am currently residing in Chicago, IL. </p>
